# textgraphics
this is a short little pixel art program where you can just draw things when ur bored, it doesn't save ur work, so if you wanna remember what u drew just take a picture of your
screen with your phone.
the graphics are entirely made from text ansi escape codes for color (256 colors) 
and i will fill in colors.h soon (it just gives vars for all the colors u can use)
